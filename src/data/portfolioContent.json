Captured in remarkable detail by James Webb's NIRCam, this planetary nebula becomes a cosmic fossil: glowing gas, dense hydrogen globules, and carbon-rich rings spiraling outward like time's own signature. Each glowing arc and filament maps the final moments of a once-sunlike star. From its carbon-based halo to its mysterious concentric ripples — likely shaped by a hidden companion — this nebula reveals the quiet complexity of stellar endings, and the chemical legacy they leave behind."
